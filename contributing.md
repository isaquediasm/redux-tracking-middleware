# CONTRIBUTING

We're really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition. üëè

## Instructions

These steps will guide you through contributing to this project:

* Fork the repo
* Clone it and install dependencies

  ```text
          git clone https://github.com/isaquediasm/redux-tracking-middleware
          yarn
  ```

Keep in mind that after running `npm install` the git repo is reset. So a good way to cope with this is to have a copy of the folder to push the changes, and the other to try them.

Make and commit your changes. Make sure the commands yarn build and yarn test:prod are working.

Finally send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/isaquediasm/redux-tracking-middleware/compare?expand=1) with a clear list of what you've done \(read more [about pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)\). Make sure all of your commits are atomic \(one feature per commit\).
